Apply SparkML+GPU in High-Energy Physics Bigdata Analysis

As the famous dialect in StarTrek said, ***Universe is the Final Frontier of Human Beings***. Nowadays, the research focus of data science has covered various aspects of human life, as well as the research of **advanced physics big data**. The usage of advanced data abalysis technique in high-energy physics help scientists accelerate their experiment workload, and finally leading to so many impressive successes all over the world.

Faced with challenges above, following architecture and components would be useful in this problem
1. **Distributed Data Anlysis System**
2. **Commercial Hardware Calculation Cluster**
3. **Heterogeneous Acclerator such as GPU**

Hence, we would propose a ***SparkML+GPU+Cloud*** framework for physics bigdata analysis, in which Cloud Cluster plays a role of infrastructure provider, Spark takes charge of calculation organization, GPU works as heterogenous accelrator. Figure1 indicates the relation between the motivation and architecture.
